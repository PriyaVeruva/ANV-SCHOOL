Established in 1990, ANV School was founded with a clear vision: to deliver quality education that nurtures academic excellence, strong values, and confident individuals. What began as a matriculation school has steadily grown, and today ANV proudly follows the Tamil Nadu State Board curriculum, offering education from Pre-KG to Grade 10.
With over three decades of dedicated service in education, ANV School has earned the trust of parents and the respect of the community as an institution committed to meaningful learning and holistic development. Our philosophy is rooted in the belief that every child is unique and deserves equal opportunities to learn, grow, and succeed.
At ANV, education goes far beyond textbooks and examinations. Our child-centric approach blends strong academics with co-scholastic activities, spoken English, life skills, and 21st-century competencies that prepare students for the challenges of a rapidly changing world. We encourage learners to think independently, communicate confidently, and act responsibly.
Our strength lies in our experienced and committed educators, a safe and inclusive campus, and a nurturing environment that supports both intellectual and emotional growth. Through structured teaching practices and continuous guidance, we ensure consistent learning standards and a strong academic foundation for every student.
Beyond academics, students at ANV are encouraged to explore their interests through sports, cultural activities, leadership opportunities, and value-based programs. This balanced approach helps develop discipline, creativity, teamwork, and social responsibility—qualities essential for success in higher education and life.
Today, ANV School stands as a trusted educational institution, dedicated to shaping responsible, disciplined, and globally aware citizens. We take pride in nurturing young minds who are not only academically capable but also confident, compassionate, and prepared for the future.
We invite you to be a part of the ANV School family and give your child a supportive, enriching, and empowering learning experience that builds a strong foundation for lifelong success.
