	description: `At ANV  School, the Innovation Lab is more than a classroom-it’s a creative playground where students experiment, invent, and innovate. With robotics, engineering, electronics, and coding, students learn by doing-designing, building, testing, and improving their ideas. Every project nurtures curiosity, collaboration, and creativity, building the foundation for lifelong learning and 21st-century success.`,
